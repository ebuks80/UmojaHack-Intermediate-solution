This exercise is my solution to the "2023 Umoja Hack Africa". Cryptojacking is a cyber-attack utilizing malicious scripts similar to those from large cryptocurrency houses to illegally mine data without users being aware. These attacks are stealthy and difficult to detect or analyze, often leading to decreased computing speeds for users as well as crashes due to straining of computational resources. The objective of this challenge is to classify network activity from various websites as either cryptojacking or not, based on features related to both network-based and host-based data. Being a purely numerical data set, alot of feature engineering would be carried out. Check the readme file for the variable defination.
